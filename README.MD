Probabilistic DTW (PDTW) algorithm by Okko Rasanen & M.A. Cruz Blandon for Zero Speech
Challenge 2020 submission for track2. See http://zerospeech.com for info on the challenge.

Use track2_main.m to run ZS2020 track2 experiments with ZS2017 datasets.

Use PDTW.m to run PDTW algorithm only (features as input, pattern timestamps as outputs)
